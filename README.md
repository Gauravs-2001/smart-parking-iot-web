Advance Smart Parking Slot Booking Management System using IoT and Web Application
This project is an Advance Smart Parking Slot Booking Management System using IoT and Web Application, designed to streamline urban parking using modern technologies. It allows users to book parking slots online and view real-time slot availability. Hardware sensors detect vehicle presence, while an automated gate controls entry. The system integrates IoT hardware (Arduino, ESP32, sensors) with a Firebase-powered backend and a PHP web application.
The aim is to reduce manual intervention, prevent congestion, and enable smart city solutions with real-time parking management.
